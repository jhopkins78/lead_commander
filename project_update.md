Major Edits to Existing Files:

lead_commander_backend/app/models/lead.py
**Added fields:** risk_score (Float), projected_ltv (Float), relationship_map (JSON/Text)
Updated __repr__ to include new fields
frontend/app.py
Added "Relationship Map" to sidebar navigation and implemented the page
Integrated pyvis network visualization for relationship mapping
Updated navigation and logic for new agent fields (risk_score, projected_ltv)
Fixed import and error handling for backend agent integration
Improved error handling and code structure
Structural Changes
The directory structure now includes:
New agent files in lead_commander_backend/app/agents/
New documentation and diagram files at the project root and in relevant subfolders
No major reorganization or renaming of exi
sting folders/files detected
The updated structure matches the planned architecture, with clear separation of backend agents, models, frontend, and documentation
Functional Changes
New Functionality:

Relationship Map page added to the Streamlit dashboard, visualizing lead relationships as an interactive network graph
Risk Score and Projected LTV fields integrated into the Lead model and available for use in the dashboard and agents
New agent classes (LeadRiskAgent, LtvAgent, RelationshipMappingAgent) with initial functional logic
Sidebar navigation updated to include all requested sections, including Relationship Map
Dashboard UI and backend logic updated to support new metrics and visualizations
Dashboard Sections:

All requested sections (Upload Leads, View Leads, Optimize Pipeline, Automate Actions, Coaching Tips, Relationship Map) are present and accessible via the sidebar
Outstanding Tasks or Issues
Known Bugs / Incomplete Features:

RelationshipMappingAgent is imported directly from the backend; this may require further packaging or API exposure for production deployment
The Relationship Map visualization assumes the presence of id, risk_score, and projected_ltv in lead data; missing or inconsistent data may cause display issues
No automated database migration scripts (manual Supabase update instructions provided)
No advanced business logic in agent classes (placeholders and simple logic only)
No automated tests for new agent logic or frontend integration
Manual Review Recommended:

Confirm that all backend agent imports work as expected in the deployment environment
Review the security and error handling of the new Relationship Map page
Validate that the database schema matches the updated Lead model and that all new fields are populated as expected
